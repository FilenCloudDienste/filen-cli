# This workflow runs when new releases are published.
# It builds the artifacts using `npm run package`.
# QEMU emulation is used for arm64 builds.
# The crypto base key for injection is read from the `FILEN_CLI_CRYPTO_BASE_KEY` environment variable.
# The current version is injected.
# All build artifacts are then attached to the release.
